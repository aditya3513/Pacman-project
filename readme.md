Introduction to AI NEU

We had to solve the problems given in Berkley Pacman project and this repo has solution to all of the problems. Each folder has a readme which describes the problem.

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley, primarily by John DeNero (denero@cs.berkeley.edu) and Dan Klein (klein@cs.berkeley.edu). For more info, see http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/home.html. Used with permission.
